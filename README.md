## About me

I am a molecular neuroscientist and computer programmer. I aspire to be a
biologist that is competent in statistics. I aim to be a better
neuroscientist using computer programing.

In my PhD, I studied networks of proteins composed of interacting
communties of protins that together compose cellular organelles like the synapse and how mutations in these
genes disrupt these networks, result in changes in biological function, and
ultimately manifest as human disorders. I am broadly interested in the study of
proteins and cells at multiple levels.

### Git Philosophy

I try to use git to track projects that are useful to me and in the hopes that
these tracks may also be useful to someone else.
