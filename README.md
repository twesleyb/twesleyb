## About me

In my PhD, I studied the proteome of the brain and how networks of interacting
proteins compose cellular organelles like the neuronal synapse.  Genetic
mutations in the genes encoding these proteins can result in changes in
biological function, and can ultimately manifest as human diseases like autism,
intellectual disability, and epilepsy. I am broadly interested in the molecular
mechanisms underlying health and disease at the level of proteins, cells, and
organisms from yeast to plants.

## My expertise

_please see my_ [resume](https://github.com/twesleyb/BradshawCV/blob/master/resume/resume.pdf) _and_ [CV](https://github.com/twesleyb/BradshawCV/blob/master/cv/cv.pdf)

* Spatial proteomics (subcellular fractionation + TMT proteomics) for high-throughput prediction of protein subcellular localization: [SwipProteomics](https://github.com/soderling-lab/SwipProteomics).
* Design, execution, and analysis of BioID proximity proteomics for identification of hard-to-reach subcellular sites, e.g. the inhibitory post-synaptic density [(iPSD)](https://github.com/soderling-lab/Uezu2016).
* Design and analysis of TMT multiplex proteomics for disease target identification: [SynaptopathyProteomics](https://github.com/soderling-lab/SynaptopathyProteomics).
* Constructing protein-protein interaction networks towards understanding biological networks [(getPPIs)](https://github.com/soderling-lab/getPPIs).
* Analysis of differential protein abundance using linear and linear mixed-effects models: [tidyProt](https://github.com/soderling-lab/tidyProt).
* Revealing structure in dense, noisy correlation networks using network enhancement [(neten)](https://github.com/soderling-lab/neten).
* CRISPR-mediated tagging of endogenous genes for target protein localization with [HiUGE](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(19)30523-9).
* CRISPR-mediated gene depletion for target functional interrogation, e.g. [InSyn1](https://elifesciences.org/articles/50712).
* Unsupervised clustering of graphs using the [Leiden](https://github.com/soderling-lab/leiden) algorithm.
* Pathway and gene set enrichment analysis [(geneLists)](https://github.com/soderling-lab/geneLists).
