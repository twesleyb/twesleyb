## About me

I am a molecular neuroscientist and computer programmer. I aspire to be a
biologist that is competent in statistics. I aim to be a better scientist using
computer programming.

In my PhD, I studied the proteome of the brain and how networks of interacting
proteins compose cellular organelles like the neuronal synapse.  Genetic mutations in
the genes encoding these proteins can result in changes in biological function, and
can ultimately manifest as human disease. I am broadly interested in the study of
proteins, cells, and organisms from yeast to plants.
