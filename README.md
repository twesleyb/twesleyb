## About me

I am a molecular neuroscientist and computer programmer. I aspire to be a
biologist that is competent in statistics. I aim to be a better scientist using
computer programming.

In my PhD, I studied the proteome of the brain and how networks of interacting
proteins compose cellular organelles like the neuronal synapse.  Genetic
mutations in the genes encoding these proteins can result in changes in
biological function, and can ultimately manifest as human diseases like autism,
intellectual disability, and epilepsy. I am broadly interested in the molecular
mechanisms underlying health and disease at the level of proteins, cells, and
organisms from yeast to plants.
